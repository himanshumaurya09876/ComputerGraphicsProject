# ComputerGraphicsProject
This project tries to depict the use of computer graphics like how we can use it and what are the amazing things that we can do using computer graphics.
In this game basically there are some oval shaped eggs continuously dropping from top of the canvas and at bottom we have a bucket in which we have to catch all those falling eggs without getting them to touch the ground, otherwise they will fall and strike the ground and then they will be broken.

So a lot of computer graphics is used here, since pythonâ€™s tkinter is used so it makes very easy to put all the graphical items like oval shaped eggs, rectangular sky and ground, circular sun and arc shaped bowl/bucket, and also all the operations like movement and disappearance of these graphical items.
